If you're on GitHub, it doesnt seem to process rst ref/doc requests correctly,
so this TOC is probably easier to read:

- `Design Philosophy <https://github.com/clark2668/icetradio/blob/master/resources/docs/design_philosophy.rst>`_.
- `Installation and Dependencies <https://github.com/clark2668/icetradio/blob/master/resources/docs/installation_dependencies.rst>`_.
- `Dataclasses <https://github.com/clark2668/icetradio/blob/master/resources/docs/dataclasses.rst>`_.
