Overview
========

:code:`icetradio` is a tool for doing radio simulations in an IceTray framework.

If you're on GitHub, it doesnt seem to process rst ref/doc requests correctly,
so this TOC is probably easier to read:

- `Design Philosophy <https://github.com/clark2668/icetradio/blob/master/resources/docs/design_philosophy.rst>`_.
- `Installation and Dependencies <https://github.com/clark2668/icetradio/blob/master/resources/docs/design_philosophy.rst>`_.
